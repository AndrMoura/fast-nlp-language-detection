# Fast text language detection 

This open-source project delivers an efficient language detection system built on FastAPI ðŸš€. It uses a Google's CLD2. It is an ideal solution for applications requiring blazing fast and reliable language detection without the need for GPU hardware.

This project functions as the backend supporting the  [lang detect plugin](https://github.com/AndrMoura/ph-langdetect-plugin) designed for use with [PostHog-LLM](https://github.com/postlang/posthog-llm).
